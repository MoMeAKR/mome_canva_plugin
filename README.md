# mOmE-Canva plugin 

A plugin for LaToile. Current version introduces a few useful hotkeys / shortcuts, accessible through the menu `CTRL+P`
Includes: 
* node color (red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, purple)
* execute: sends to local (for now) API 

I think most tools could actually be plugged in...
